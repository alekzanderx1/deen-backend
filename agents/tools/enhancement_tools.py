    """
    Enhance a user's query by adding context and improving it for better document retrieval.
    
    Use this tool to improve the quality of queries before retrieving documents from the database.
    The enhancement process:
    - Adds relevant context from chat history
    - Expands abbreviations and clarifies ambiguous terms
    - Reformulates the query to be more specific and retrieval-friendly
    - Preserves the original intent while making it more searchable
    
    Args:
        query: The user's original query
        session_id: The conversation session ID to access chat history for context
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with:
        - enhanced_query (str): The improved, context-enriched query
        - original_query (str): The original user query
        
    Example:
        Original: "Tell me more about him"
        Enhanced: "Tell me more about Imam Ali, the first Imam in Shia Islam"
        
    When to use:
    - Before retrieving documents from the knowledge base
    - When the query is short or lacks context
    - When chat history provides relevant context
    
    When NOT to use:
    - For very simple, self-contained queries
    - When the query is already detailed and specific
    - After classification determines the query is non-Islamic or fiqh
